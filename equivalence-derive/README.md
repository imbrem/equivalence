**Important Note**:

* You are probably looking for the [`equivalence`](https://docs.rs/equivalence/) crate, which wraps this crate and is much more ergonomic to use.

Purpose
-------

This is an internal helper library of [`equivalence`](https://docs.rs/equivalence/), containing the derive macro for `#[derive(Equivalence)]`
